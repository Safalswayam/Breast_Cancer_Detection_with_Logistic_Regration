# Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression

This project detects breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from scikit-learn. It applies a logistic regression model with proper preprocessing, visualizations, and evaluation metrics.

## Features

- 📊 Visualization of class distribution and feature correlation.
- ⚙️ StandardScaler preprocessing.
- 🧠 Logistic Regression model with O(log n) inference complexity.
- ✅ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
- 💾 Model saved using `joblib` for portability.

## How to Run

1. Install requirements using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run `Breast_Cancer_Detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. The trained model (`.joblib`) can be reused for predictions.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for necessary packages.
